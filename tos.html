            <li>
              The <strong>PyDelhi Conference 2023</strong> tickets delivered to you are not meant to be used for illegal reselling, copying, reproducing, or misrepresenting in any form. You cannot use the ticket(s) for any promotional/advertising purposes either (<em>including sweepstakes and competitions</em>) without our prior approval. Any proven record of such activities will result in immediate seizure and cancellation of your ticket(s).
            </li>
            <li>
              Please note that <strong>PyDelhi Conference 2023</strong> tickets cannot be redeemed against cash, credits, or any other benefits.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>PyDelhi</strong> has the right to investigate if there has been any violation of the <strong>PyDelhi Conference 2023</strong> ticketing terms and conditions. In case of any conflicts, the decision of <strong>PyDelhi</strong> will be deemed final (<em>i.e., the issuer will remain the final arbiter in cases of disputes</em>).
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are not able to access any particular section(s) of the venue - <strong>Conference Centre, University of Delhi</strong> - due to delays, Government regulations, organiser policies, weather-related problems, emergencies, venue shutdown/evacuation or any other reason, you will not be eligible for any refunds or future credits.

            </li>
            <li>
              Losses, if any, occurring due to foreign exchange fluctuations at the time of refunds, have to be borne by the purchaser. <strong>PyDelhi</strong> cannot be, in any way, held liable for that.

            <li>
              All ticket sales are deemed as FINAL TRANSACTIONS. There will be no ticket returns/exchanges/cancellations.
            </li>
