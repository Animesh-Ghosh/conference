The Zen of Python serves as a foundational framework, providing guiding principles that, when applied, help to avoid such pitfalls. Often, when working on quick prototypes, it is common for code to be hastily developed and deployed without thorough consideration. This can result in numerous potential issues arising in a production environment. In order to address this, we aim to revisit the concepts of the Zen of Python and explore how they can be effectively applied in typical scenarios. The goal is to produce high-quality code that is safe for production, minimizing the potential for any detrimental impacts.The subject of this talk is not new or unique. Similar topics have been covered in other PyCon chapters. The intended audience is beginners, with the goal of sharing insights and inviting audience participation to explore beyond the topics I have already mentioned.",

				"description": "Validating API requests and formatting responses are integral aspects of the API lifecycle, but the multitude of approaches available can lead to repetitive and convoluted code, making responses complex and difficult to interpret. In this conference talk, we will explore how Pydantic models can be utilized to mitigate repetition by streamlining request validation. Additionally, we will demonstrate the efficacy of storing mock responses to enhance contract visibility. By integrating Mako templates into the development process, we can easily manage cosmetic changes in responses while maintaining the clarity of core services and introduce design first and then develop philosophy. Attendees will gain valuable insights and practical techniques to elevate their Python development process, resulting in more efficient and maintainable APIs.",
