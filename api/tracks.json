The Zen of Python serves as a foundational framework, providing guiding principles that, when applied, help to avoid such pitfalls. Often, when working on quick prototypes, it is common for code to be hastily developed and deployed without thorough consideration. This can result in numerous potential issues arising in a production environment. In order to address this, we aim to revisit the concepts of the Zen of Python and explore how they can be effectively applied in typical scenarios. The goal is to produce high-quality code that is safe for production, minimizing the potential for any detrimental impacts.The subject of this talk is not new or unique. Similar topics have been covered in other PyCon chapters. The intended audience is beginners, with the goal of sharing insights and inviting audience participation to explore beyond the topics I have already mentioned. ",
